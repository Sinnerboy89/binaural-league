# binaural-league
One fairly well-qualified enthusiast's journey of analysis and discovery through the myriad of spatial/3D/binaural audio solutions currently available, and their attempts to rank them with various metrics of goodness. Inspired by the overwhelming choice of vendors all claiming to do the exact same thing, and motivated by my continuing underwhelm-ment of everything I've seen and heard so far (so expect razor-sharp criticism and perhaps a little sarcasm).

# Rules
* Whilst platform compatibility, wrappers and applied example "scenes" are noted and appreciated - when it comes to judging the solution itself, only the core SDK/engine in its native language will be considered. I don't care that your software runs in Unity 5.4.03.30.g5.patch2017 with minimal effort or can render in real-time on your dog's dumbphone, if it sounds sh\*t on my ATH-40x headphones on my dev laptop with simple demo code that I've written with your SDK and documentation, then that's down to the fundamental maths/physics/DSP gubbins in your "solution".
I may rethink this mindset once I start sifting through the mountain below.
